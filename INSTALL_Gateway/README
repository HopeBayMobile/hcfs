What are in this directory?
    The files in this directory are for installing the software of a storage gateway from a clean OS.


Requirement:
    1. Ubuntu 12.04 Server amd64
    2. Two NICs, and internet is available.
    3. A /storage/ folder (need to build it by hand on a VM)
    4. Soruce code directory structure being the same as 5th July 2012 on GitHub.


Function of files:

install_gateway_all_in_one.sh
    This script install S3ql, GUI api and GUI codes into the system and
    configure necessary files/folder access permissions.

DOM_gw_run_this_first.sh
    It will build a RAID1 on sdb and sdc on a TB1 machine with a DOM on sda.
    If you want to test it on a VM, create 400GB sdb and sdc on the VM.

create_apt_list.sh
    There are lots of dependency of software packages are available in
    Internet.  In case there is no Internet connection in first installation,
    we may not be able to download software packages from Internet (Delta Ubuntu
    APT server). Since most of standard software packages are included in ubuntu
    install dvd iso file, thus we download the Install dvd iso of Ubuntu Precise in
    [1] and build a ubuntu repository locally. Without Internet connection, we can
    install software packages from this local ubuntu repository.
    The script below is currently integrated within DOM; it should work without DOM.
