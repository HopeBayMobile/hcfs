[Purpose]
    There are times that savebox is having a new build while other components are not. 
    In current cross teamwork, it is time consuming to do file transferring via internet and build new gateway package from scratch.
    Therefore, the program in this folder is for rebuild gateway package with a new savebox DEB file.
    
[Warning]
    This function is only for SaveBox developers' agile testing. It will not handle gateway build version number, 
    thus it is not suitable for QA's testing.
