	(3) Hardware: AMD 64bit


2. How to use the scripts:

	(2) Change your privilege to root.
	(3) Modify the [storage] section in Swift.ini:
            password = password of root in swift nodes
            replica = how many replica of data do you want
            deviceCnt = how many disks to use in each swift node
`
	(4) Execute 'python setup.py install'
	(5) Edit /etc/delta/proxyNodes in the following format:
              ip1
              ip2
              ... 
        (6) Edit /etc/delta/storageNodes in the following format:

              ip2 zid2
              ...
            
            where zid has to be a positive integer less than 10.
              
	(7) execute dcloud_swift_deploy



[Note]:
1. The command "dcloud_swift_deploy" is for the convenience of testing. 
   Onec PDCM is ready, we don't have to edit /etc/delta/storageNodes and /etc/delta/proxyNodes. 
   PDCM will assign the IPs of proxy and storage nodes automatically.

2. The logs and error handling are not ready yet! Some logs can be found 
   in /var/log/deltaSwift.

3. For PDCM, please replace /etc/init.d/rc with misc/BootScripts/rc when building golden image.
   Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.local with misc/BootScripts/rc.local

4. For PDCM, please copy misc/BootScripts/rc.py to /etc/rc.py when building golden image.
   Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.py with misc/BootScripts/rc.py
