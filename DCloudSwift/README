[Description]:
1. The scripts is used to deploy Swift. The development environment is listed
   in the following.
	(1) OS: Ubuntu 11.04 64 bits
	(2) Language: python and bash shell
	(3) Hardware: AMD 64bit


[Installation]
1. Copy the folder 'DCloudSwift' to the master node.
2. Deploy swift
	(1) Change your privilege to root.
	(2) Execute 'python setup.py install'
	(3) Edit ./Swift.ini:
	    [storage]
            password = password of root in swift nodes
            deviceCnt = how many disks to use in each swift node
	    proxyPort = the port on which the swift-proxy should listen
	   
            [portal]
            url = url of the public access portal for users
        (4) Add [deploy] section to /etc/delta/inputFile in the following format:
              ip1 zid1
              ip2 zid2
              ...
            
              where zid has to be a positive integer less than 10.
              Note that the master node to run this deploy script cannot be included 
              in this list.
              
	(5) execute "dcloud_swift_deploy numOfReplcia"
            where numOfReplica has to be a positive integer less than 10 

3. setup event manager
        (1) Add [nodeList] section to /etc/delta/inputFile in the following format:
              hostname1
              hostname2
              ...
            
            where hostnameX are the hostname of nodes you want to monitor.

	(2) Execute "dcloud_clear_node_info"
        (3) Execute "dcloud_clear_backlog"
	(4) Execute "dcloud_initialize_node_info"
        (5) Execute "dcloud_initialize_backlog"
        (6) Execute "/etc/init.d/swift-event-manager"
        (7) Execute "/etc/init.d/swift-maintain-switcher"
        (8) Execute "/etc/init.d/swift-maintain-agent"

[Note]:
1. The command "dcloud_swift_deploy" is for the convenience of testing. 
   Onec PDCM is ready, we don't have to edit /etc/delta/storageNodes and /etc/delta/proxyNodes. 
   PDCM will assign the IPs of proxy and storage nodes automatically.

2. The logs and error handling are not ready yet! Some logs can be found 
   in /var/log/deltaSwift.

3. For PDCM, please replace /etc/init.d/rc with misc/BootScripts/rc when building golden image.
   Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.local with misc/BootScripts/rc.local

4. For PDCM, please copy misc/BootScripts/rc.py to /etc/rc.py when building golden image.
   Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.py with misc/BootScripts/rc.py

5. For PDCM0.4, please create /srv and /DCloudSwift when building golden image.
