        2. How to use the scripts:
        	(1) Copy the folder 'DCloudSwift' to the master node.
        	(2) Change your privilege to root.
        	(3) Execute 'python setup.py install'
        	(4) Edit ./Swift.ini:
        	    [storage]
                    password = password of root in swift nodes
                    deviceCnt = how many disks to use in each swift node
        	    proxyPort = the port on which the swift-proxy should listen
        	   
                    [portal]
                    url = url of the public access portal for users

        [Note]:
        1. The command "dcloud_swift_deploy" is for the convenience of testing. 
           Onec PDCM is ready, we don't have to edit /etc/delta/storageNodes and /etc/delta/proxyNodes. 
           PDCM will assign the IPs of proxy and storage nodes automatically.
        
        2. The logs and error handling are not ready yet! Some logs can be found 
           in /var/log/deltaSwift.
        
        3. For PDCM, please replace /etc/init.d/rc with misc/BootScripts/rc when building golden image.
           Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.local with misc/BootScripts/rc.local
        
        4. For PDCM, please copy misc/BootScripts/rc.py to /etc/rc.py when building golden image.
           Otherwise, please replace starage&proxy nodes' /etc/rc.py with misc/BootScripts/rc.py
        
        5. For PDCM0.4, please create /srv and /DCloudSwift when building golden image.
