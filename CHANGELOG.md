## Known Issues / Limitations / Features to be Implemented
 1. Encryption is not enabled now. Some crash issue occurred in the previous build when encryption is turned on (during decryption), and was not yet retested in this build.
 2. If cache is full during recording video, user need to wait cache been flush to storage after recording finished.
 3. When installing an app, pinned space must contain enough space for the app as the installation process will first download the content to the pinned space.
 4. Data upload to the device via USB might fail if the amount of data to upload on the device plus the data to be uploaded exceeds cache size, and the network speed is slow.
 5. (A temp fix for crash issue) Files in /data/app are pinned now. An "unpin" action will not unpin files in the app package folder under /data/app.

  6. 設定中"WIFI連線時上傳資料" 應該是 "只有WIFI連線時才上傳". Turn off時會是如果有網路連線就上傳.
  7. 資料傳輸量不會每日重設.
  8. 系統使用上有不穩定的情形. 正在除錯中.
  Note: The API server included in the build is not built from the source tagged on git, but from a previous binary built by Yuxun (some problem occurred when using the binary built from the tagged source code). This will be tracked further.

v 2.0.2.0003
=====
## New Features
  1. User apps are now stored in HCFS
  2. Supports app pin / unpin
  3. FIFO / socket are supported.
  4. "只有WIFI連線才能上傳" implemented 

## Fixes
  1. 本地空間使用顯示已正常
  2. 修正一些UI上點選時看起來會有動作但是實際上為不可點選

## Known Issues / Limitations / Features to be Implemented
  1. Android SELinux security disabled for now until security policies are fixed.
  2. Backend quota (ArkflexU) not yet supported.
  3. For the 2.0.2.0003 image, the debug log of the device (under /mtklog) writes constantly to the storage space. This could fill up the pinned space quickly (if the directory is pinned), or compete for cache space / upload bandwidth (if unpinned). If /mtklog is pinned, the size won't grow if all pinned space is occupied.
  4. Encryption is not enabled now. Some crash issue occurred in the previous build when encryption is turned on (during decryption), and was not yet retested in this build.
  5. 錄影時如果cache已滿, 停止錄影後會需要耐心等候錄影的cache flush to storage.
  6. 首頁上會多出兩個"系統" 圖示. 目前無功用.
  7. 設定中"WIFI連線時上傳資料" 應該是 "只有WIFI連線時才上傳". Turn off時會是如果有網路連線就上傳.

v 2.0.1.0002
=====
## Fixes
  1. Fixed hang issues due to timeout when calling curl lib.
  2. Fixed some variable conversion issues.
  3. Reduced thread numbers.
  4. Fixed an issue re undeleted temp files if curl operations (upload, download, delete remote object, etc) failed.
  5. Fixed cache size in default configuration file for testing Acer machines. In the old setting, the size of the cache hard limit is larger than the available disk space for cache purpose.
  6. Enhanced network error handling.
  7. Some libraries are now included as shared libraries.
  8. Fixed upload policy

## Known Issues / Limitations / Features to be Implemented
  1. Support App data storage space on cloud filesystem (internal storage space).
  2. App may not be able to access app-specific part of the external storage if it does not request for external storage permission (uid modeling of app-specific space on external storage not yet done).
  3. Android SELinux security disabled for now until security policies are fixed.
  4. Backend quota (ArkflexU) not yet supported.
  5. FIFO type filesystem object not yet supported in HCFS.
  6. Switch for sync to backend (turn sync on/off) not yet implemented.
  7. For the 2.0.1.0001 image, the debug log of the device (under /mtklog) writes constantly to the storage space. This could fill up the pinned space quickly (if the directory is pinned), or compete for cache space / upload bandwidth (if unpinned). If /mtklog is pinned, the size won't grow if all pinned space is occupied.
  8. Encryption is not enabled now. Some crash issue occurred in the previous build when encryption is turned on (during decryption), and was not yet retested in this build.

v 2.0.1.0001
=====
## New Features
  1. Cache-based cloud filesystem on Android phone (external storage space only now)
  2. Cloud storage setup via management app
  3. File / media pin / unpin via management app (no app pin / unpin yet)
  4. System monitoring via management app

## Known Issues / Limitations / Features to be Implemented
  1. Support App data storage space on cloud filesystem (internal storage space).
  2. App may not be able to access app-specific part of the external storage if it does not request for external storage permission (uid modeling of app-specific space on external storage not yet done).
  3. App / TeraFonn might hang when browsing image content on management app. Reboot phone will fix the situation.
  4. Android SELinux security disabled for now until security policies are fixed.
  5. Backend quota (ArkflexU) not yet supported.
  6. FIFO type filesystem object not yet supported in HCFS.
  7. Switch for sync to backend (turn sync on/off) not yet implemented.
  8. Error handling for network disconnection not included in this build
