After installing the OS (Ubuntu 11.04) on system volume server,
you should execute SystemVolumeDeploy.sh.

The script will do the following things:
(1) Install GlusterFS 3.2.3
(2) Create two directory /export1 and /export2
(3) Mount /dev/sdb on /export2 
(4) Create a GlusterFS volume using /export1 and /export2 as bricks
(5) Return a mount point (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/SystemVolume)
