[Description]:
1. The scripts is used to deploy Swift. The development environment is listed
   in the following.
	(1) OS: Ubuntu 11.04 64bit
	(2) Language: python and bash shell
	(3) Hardware: AMD 64bit

2. How to use the scripts:
	(1) Copy the folder 'swif_InstallScripts' to the master node.
	(2) Modify the '__main__' section of swift_InstallScripts/master/SwiftDeploy.py
	    SD = SwiftDeploy("./Swift.ini", [PROXY_NODE_IP], [STORAGE_NODE_IP])
	    Modify PROXY_NODE_IP and STORAGE_NODE_IP to your proxy node IP and 
	    storage node IP, respectively.
	(3) Change your privilege to root.
	(4) Execute the command: python SwiftDeploy.py


[Note]:
1. The existence of the master node is for the use of PDCM. When PDCM is ready, 
   we don't have to modify the proxy node IP and storage node IP in SwiftDeploy.py. 
   PDCM will assign the IPs of proxy and storage nodes automatically. However, a 
   few codes must be writen to connect the scripts with PDCM.

2. The scripts do not support the mutiple proxy servers.

3. The logs and error handling are not ready yet! Some logs can be found 
   in /var/log/SwiftDeploy of the master node.
