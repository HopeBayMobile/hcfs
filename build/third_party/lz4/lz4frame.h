 *
 * dstBuffer is supposed to be flushed between each call to the function, since its content will be overwritten.
 * dst arguments can be changed at will with each consecutive call to the function.
 *
 * The function result is an hint of how many srcSize bytes LZ4F_decompress() expects for next call.
 * Schematically, it's the size of the current (or remaining) compressed block + header of next block.
 * Respecting the hint provides some boost to performance, since it does skip intermediate buffers.
 * This is just a hint, you can always provide any srcSize you want.
 * When a frame is fully decoded, the function result will be 0 (no more data expected).
 * If decompression failed, function result is an error code, which can be tested using LZ4F_isError().
 *
 * After a frame is fully decoded, dctx can be used again to decompress another frame.
