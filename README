=== Storage Gateway ===
How to install:
    Go to INSTALL_gateway

Known issues:
    * /etc/init/pre-gwstart.conf will not be changed for 'STORAGE_ADDR' when the user applys a new system configuration on GUI.
    * /etc/delta/gw_bktask.py was not launched after boot on some gateways.
    * api_restore_conf.py should be refined for better performance.
